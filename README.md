# Udacity-ABTesting
A/B Tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.
In this project under Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program, an e-commerce website wants to add a new page to their website.
My task is to determine whether they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
